# \# EmoSort AI – Emotion Classification System

# 

# \## Problem Statement

# Manual classification of facial emotions in images is time-consuming and error-prone.

# This project aims to automate emotion detection and organize images based on predicted emotions.

# 

# \## Solution

# A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on facial expression images to classify emotions.

# The predicted label is used to automatically sort images into emotion-specific categories.

# 

# \## Dataset

# \- FER-2013 facial emotion dataset

# \- 7 emotion classes

# \- Grayscale images (48x48)

# 

# \## Tech Stack

# \- Python

# \- TensorFlow / Keras

# \- NumPy, OpenCV

# \- Scikit-learn

# \- Matplotlib

# 

# \## Model Overview

# \- CNN with convolutional and pooling layers

# \- ReLU activation, Softmax output

# \- Adam optimizer with categorical crossentropy loss

# 

# \## Results

# \- Achieved approximately 63–68% validation accuracy

# \- Model evaluated using accuracy curves and confusion matrix

# 

# \## How to Run
